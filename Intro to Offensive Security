## Go Buster ##
You can use this to brute-force FakeBank's website to find hidden directories and paes. GoBuster will take a list of potential pages or directory names and tries accessing a website with each of  them. 
If the page exists, it tells you.

At a terminal line type:
- gobuster -u https://fakebank.com -w wordlist.txt dir

-u is used to state the website we are scanning
-w takes a list of words to iterate through to find hidden pages

Find the 200 code and then apend that file to the URL of the website you are viewing.
